			<li><h2>Bahama Breeze<h2></li>	
				<a href="https://www.bahamabreeze.com/home"><img src= "https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/fetch/c_fill,h_500,q_90/https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/upload/crm/tampabay/Bahama_Breeze_Exterior_Tampa0-c57978105056a36_c5797943-5056-a36a-08aa96cd1571754f.jpg"/></a>
				<p>Bahama breeze has got to be on the top of my list, simply for the experiences I'v had here. While locations are primarily in Florida, they are slowly working their way up the east coast with a location now hitting NC, in dead-center Raleigh!</p>
			
			<li><h2>Tropical Smoothie Cafe<h2></li>
				<a href="https://www.tropicalsmoothiecafe.com/"><img src="https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/12/2c/19/af/tropical-smoothie-storefront.jpg"/></a>
				<p>Like Bahama Breeze, Tropical Smoothie Cafe primarily resides in FL. Although this chain has far more options all over North America, including right here in Charlotte, NC.</p>
			
			<li><h2>Phoenix Thai & Japanese<h2></li>
				<a href="http://myphoenixrestaurant.com/"><img src="https://hoodline.imgix.net/uploads/story/image/313176/sushi.jpg?auto=format"/></a>
				<p>Phoenix is a standalone restaurant located in Mooresville, NC. This is by far one of the best places to get several types of asian food. As the name suggests, one of their key styles is japanese, in both dinner and dessert!</p>
			
			<li><h2>Viva Chicken<h2></li>
				<a href="https://vivachicken.com/"><img src="https://vivachicken.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Elizabeth-Avenue-NC.jpg" width="75%" /></a>
				<p>While Viva Chicken is centered around Peruvian recipes and culture, this is a Charlotte home-grown restaurant. It's first location opened in 2013 on Elizabeth Avenue!</p>
			
			<li><h2>Pollo Tropical<h2></li>
				<a href="https://www.pollotropical.com/"><img src="https://www.nrn.com/sites/nrn.com/files/styles/article_featured_standard/public/PolloTropical_2017_ext2a_0.png?itok=TqzCwgzF" /></a>
				<p>While Pollo remains another island-life themed restaurant on the list, it certainly has the most locations out of the 5, making it a bit more accessible. There are currently 178 locations in Florida alone, totaling 233 across the United States. I would conider Pollo a hybrid-mixture between Viva Chicken and KFC.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><p>My Kitchen<p></li>
						<p>This would be the place where I get one thing that the other options on the list can't offer, and that's control. I get to control how my food looks, tastes, smells, and anything in between. Other than avoiding cooking it myself, what more could you need?</p>
